## Roadmap

- Transactions scraping into Xero

- SH invoices -> Create invoice on Xero -> We need to create matching bills for each candidate we need pay with ref to each candidate.
    >> Import all candidate contacts and details into xero
    >> Create a bill for each candidate
- PDF and email invoices from Linear, send to Xero as bill with matching transaction, and inform accountants to reconcile this new transaction.

- Plugn Godaddy subscription:
 >> Make sure clients are paying for domains
 >> Make sure we are paying for domains
 >> Subscription schedule

- 

### Things to cover

Do roadmap, how will you structure each account + what details will be stored for each subscription and how it’s accounted. Eg: domains are subscriptions , but they bill customers a multiple/fixed price when it’s due. 

Ask about “Accounts”- refactoring into ppl/ where do payable go until we pay them? Bawes payable credit, Debit Person receivable ? Every person and org needs list of receivables and payables (how much they owe and how much they’re owed). With refs to each other for backstory?
