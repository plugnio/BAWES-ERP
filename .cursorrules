# Development Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused and incremental
- Keep code clean and readable, simple and easy to understand
- Keep code scalable and easy to scale
- Test your work and confirm it works before presenting it

# FinancialGuidelines
- All financial calculations must use decimal.js library
- Never use native JavaScript floating-point arithmetic for monetary values
- Always import Decimal from 'decimal.js' when handling currency
- Enforce strict type checking for all monetary values
- Monetary values should always be of type Decimal
- Validate decimal places (max 2 for standard currency)
- Cache Decimal instances outside loops when possible
- Use decimal.js methods instead of native JavaScript methods for precision
- Implement proper error handling and logging for financial calculations
- Regularly review and update decimal precision requirements
