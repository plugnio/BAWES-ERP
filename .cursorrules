Keep in mind that this project is a Nestjs backend, for frontends in other projects. No frontend will be implemented in this project.

# Development Guidelines
- Project docs are under /docs
- We use Github actions for publishing swagger as SDK for frontend usage
- SDK publishing is to a regular github repo, no registry, not github packages or npm registry
- Keep changes small and focused and incremental
- Keep code clean and readable, simple and easy to understand
- Keep code scalable and easy to scale
- Test your work and confirm it works before presenting it

# SDK Development Workflow
1. Feature Branch Development:
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
   - SDK automatically generated on push
   - SDK branch matches feature branch name
   - Version format: `0.0.0-feature-name-timestamp`

2. SDK Testing:
   - Frontend can use branch-specific SDK
   - SDK updates on every push to feature branch
   - No interference with production SDK
   - Manual SDK generation via workflow dispatch

3. Branch Strategy:
   - feature/* -> Creates matching SDK branch
   - dev -> Updates dev SDK branch
   - main -> Updates production SDK with versioning
   - Each branch gets its own SDK branch

4. Version Management:
   - Feature branches: `0.0.0-branch-timestamp`
   - Dev branch: `0.0.0-dev-timestamp`
   - Main branch: Semantic versioning
   - Breaking changes trigger major version bump

# FinancialGuidelines
- All financial calculations must use decimal.js library
- Never use native JavaScript floating-point arithmetic for monetary values
- Always import Decimal from 'decimal.js' when handling currency
- Enforce strict type checking for all monetary values
- Monetary values should always be of type Decimal
- Validate decimal places (max 2 for standard currency)
- Cache Decimal instances outside loops when possible
- Use decimal.js methods instead of native JavaScript methods for precision
- Implement proper error handling and logging for financial calculations
- Regularly review and update decimal precision requirements
